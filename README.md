# Repository File Structure

This repository contains two main files:

1. **MyNewProject**: This file follows the Diligent getting started tutorial. In this project, we have tried to implement a clock divider.

2. **project_new_start_try_DC**: This file is also based on the Diligent getting started tutorial. The aim of this project is to make a PLL clock wizard dynamically configurable.


The VitisWorkspace folder contains the example project files I used to test if dynamic clock was working
